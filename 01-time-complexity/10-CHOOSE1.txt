Which of the following is not bounded by O(n^2)?


Option A: (15^10) * n + 12099
Option B: n^1.98
Option C: n^3 / (sqrt(n))
Option D: (2^20) * n

Answer: Option C.

Explanation:
As per asymptotic analysis, we will be ignoring the constants and lower order coefficients while determining the time and space complexity of an algorithm.

Option A: n
Option B: n ^ 2 <= n ^ 2
Option C: n ^ 3 > n ^ 2
Option D: n

By checking all the results Option C is not bounded by O(N ^ 2)
