What is the time complexity of the following code :

int i, j, k = 0;
for (i = n/2; i <= n; i++) {
    for (j = 2; j <= n; j = j * 2) {
         k = k + n/2;
    }
}

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

Explanation:
Inner loop runs logn times at each iteration start.
Outer loop runs n / 2 number of times

(n / 2) * logn
